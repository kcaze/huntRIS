Design Specification:
1. Hotkey to allow for screengrabbing part of the site and reverse google image search that.
2. Context menu for images to reverse google image search the entire menu.


Idea of implementation:
1. chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab in order to capture current visible webpage as image, then use javascript to determine the coordinates of the grabbed section relative to current visible webpage. Do some cropping on a canvas, send to google reverse image search and then open up a new tab with the search results.
