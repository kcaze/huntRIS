hunt Reverse Image Search is a Google Chrome extension that
allows you to screenshot a web page and select a portion of it to 
reverse image search. This is helpful for when the multiple images have
been combined together and you only want to reverse image search part of
the composited image. Furthermore, you can reverse image search videos
by pausing the video, taking a screenshot, and then reverse image searching
the screenshot.
